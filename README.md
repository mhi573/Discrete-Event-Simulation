# Discrete-Event-Simulation:
MSDS460 Course Project: Coffee Shop Simulation with Balking, Reneging, and Agent Variability
The purpose of this project wass to address a problem with a real-world process.  Discrete event simulation methods were employed. The process involved various activities and resources, and the simulation generated data for analysis. The simulation provided the opportunity to explore the problem with what-if scenarios. The discrete event simulation generated event logs with at least three essential components: a case identifier, timestamp, and activity/event name.
