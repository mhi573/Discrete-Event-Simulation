# Executive Summary
This study conducted an analysis that employed discrete event simulation (DES; Allen, Spencer, and Gibson, 2015) in Python using the SimPy package (simpy.readthedocs.io, 2020) to simulate processes and behaviors in a cafe and bistro business setting. The aim of this study sought to implement DES and explore ways to improve processes - namely, customers arriving and being served. This aim was explored by implementing DES to simulate a unique dining experience: one where the restaurant staff served the customer throughout their entire experience. 
In this analysis, 1,000 customers were served and this scenario suggested that this would take nearly three full days. Following the implementation and interpretation of this DES exercise, there were four areas for the café and bistro to consider: 1) staff optimization, 2) process enhancements, 3) technology integration, and 4) customer experience. The unique dining experience should be revised to optimize the way in which servers are utilized. Unless the café and bistro expect to operate 24/7 then it may be prudent to assign servers to complete one or two specific activities rather than completing all activities per customer.
